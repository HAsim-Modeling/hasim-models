Checked in Instruction Cache integration with Unpipelined
Model. ICache is direct-mapped and blocking. CPU uses 0 latency APorts
to communicate with Cache module. The Cache module uses 10 latency
APorts to communicate with dummy memory module on a cache miss.The
Also modified in-order pipeline model to integrate this ICache.

- added model cycle count to the debug files generated by the inorder
  models.
- connected the PortCtrl interfaces of StallPorts to the local
  controller. This prevents the timing model from issuing requests
  until the dynamic parameters have been initialized. The more correct
  way of doing this would be to add guards to the dynamic paramters,
  but this works for now, and probably saves some luts.
- fixed bug in Fetch; the icache req & resp a-ports were being
  accessed atomically in one rule. This deadlocks when both a-ports
  are 0-delay (which they are right now.)
- replaced $display's in Fetch by the DebugFile method calls.

Modified cache interface by splitting response from cache to CPU into
two APorts. One APort is used to indicate an immediate response and
the other one is used to provide data that has been serviced on a
cache miss. Cache response also provides the ISA_ADDRESS corresponding
to each miss type.
Added module for a set-associative cache. Currently operates on a
simple round-robin replacement algorithm.
Modified AWB files to set cache parameters through AWB.

Added an ICacheTypes.bsv file holding to include cache configuration
parameters in multiple modules of the ICache. Created a mkReplacement
module to account for replacement policies for the set-associative
ICache. Currently implemented LRU as a possible replacement
policy. LRU has been tested with the Unpipelined CPU model and passes
the memory tests. Also modified Unpipelined CPU to yield correct IPC
in the stats dump.

funcp_getResults now returns a struct with enough information to deal with
redirecting of taken and not-taken branches.  In addition to taken branch
targets it also includes the address and size of the current instruction.

Added separate dummy memory modules for ICache and DCache. Modified
direct-mapped and set-associative ICache to service requests from the
CPU despite processing a previous miss in the background. Added a
write-through direct mapped data cache that currently takes one input
port. A future modification will be the separation of speculative
input ports and commit input ports.
Modified unpipeline module to deal with new ICache in conjunction with
DCache.
Created a separate DCache types file to gather paramerization of the
DCache infrastructure.
Modified cache interface to take both the PC and the address
referenced for reads and writes to the data cache.
