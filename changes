Make hasim_cpu a synthesis boundary.
Needed to change some enum names to avoid namespace collision.

- Several bugfixes in the new fivestage model.
- Passes hello and memory_tests_aligned, however the datapath debug output is
  different from unpipelined(!!)

- added apms for smips
- added apms for HTG-v5-PCIe

Checked in Instruction Cache integration with Unpipelined
Model. ICache is direct-mapped and blocking. CPU uses 0 latency APorts
to communicate with Cache module. The Cache module uses 10 latency
APorts to communicate with dummy memory module on a cache miss.The
Also modified in-order pipeline model to integrate this ICache.

Add a commit message to the controller so heartbeat can calculate IPC.
