Checked in Instruction Cache integration with Unpipelined
Model. ICache is direct-mapped and blocking. CPU uses 0 latency APorts
to communicate with Cache module. The Cache module uses 10 latency
APorts to communicate with dummy memory module on a cache miss.The
Also modified in-order pipeline model to integrate this ICache.

- added model cycle count to the debug files generated by the inorder
  models.
- connected the PortCtrl interfaces of StallPorts to the local
  controller. This prevents the timing model from issuing requests
  until the dynamic parameters have been initialized. The more correct
  way of doing this would be to add guards to the dynamic paramters,
  but this works for now, and probably saves some luts.
- fixed bug in Fetch; the icache req & resp a-ports were being
  accessed atomically in one rule. This deadlocks when both a-ports
  are 0-delay (which they are right now.)
- replaced $display's in Fetch by the DebugFile method calls.

Modified cache interface by splitting response from cache to CPU into
two APorts. One APort is used to indicate an immediate response and
the other one is used to provide data that has been serviced on a
cache miss. Cache response also provides the ISA_ADDRESS corresponding
to each miss type.
Added module for a set-associative cache. Currently operates on a
simple round-robin replacement algorithm.
Modified AWB files to set cache parameters through AWB.

Added an ICacheTypes.bsv file holding to include cache configuration
parameters in multiple modules of the ICache. Created a mkReplacement
module to account for replacement policies for the set-associative
ICache. Currently implemented LRU as a possible replacement
policy. LRU has been tested with the Unpipelined CPU model and passes
the memory tests. Also modified Unpipelined CPU to yield correct IPC
in the stats dump.

funcp_getResults now returns a struct with enough information to deal with
redirecting of taken and not-taken branches.  In addition to taken branch
targets it also includes the address and size of the current instruction.

Added separate dummy memory modules for ICache and DCache. Modified
direct-mapped and set-associative ICache to service requests from the
CPU despite processing a previous miss in the background. Added a
write-through direct mapped data cache that currently takes one input
port. A future modification will be the separation of speculative
input ports and commit input ports.
Modified unpipeline module to deal with new ICache in conjunction with
DCache.
Created a separate DCache types file to gather paramerization of the
DCache infrastructure.
Modified cache interface to take both the PC and the address
referenced for reads and writes to the data cache.

Move 5 stage model from hasim-mips here.  Also moved branch predictors
and a few other structures.  5 stage model is now a single awb file since
it is supposed to be a simple example.

Added direct-mapped, write-through data cache code. Data cache has two
ports (one of which handles loads and the other commits
stores). During stall times, miss retry signals and invalids are sent
back to the pipeline as appropriate. It is assumed that a separate
store buffer module will be created to take care of the effects of
speculative stores and will deal with corresponding aliasing issues.

Addded set-associative write-back blocking data cache. This design
uses two distinct ports for the loads and stores. The design
necessitated the creation of a replacement algorithm module for the
data cache. Currently, this is implemented with an LRU module. 
The Null cache modules have also been adjusted to fix a couple of
import errors.
The ICache set-associative model has also been adjusted to fix
existing bugs as has the DCache direct-mapped module.

Fixed bug in set-associative dcache. When handling both a commited
store and a load request, the data cache now ensures that only one can
be serviced at a time since it is purely blocking.

Now that there's only one version of the pipeline, update it so that it uses the new interface correctly.

Nikhil: please check that we kept the correct version of the inorder pipeline. 
We are afraid we may have reverted some of your changes accidentally.

Added support for drainBefore/drainAfter to OOO model. It still runs out of
tokens, but this does remove the warnings from M5 about executing a halt
instruction.

Murali should look this over to see if the scheme is reasonable (it's basically
the same as the one I added to the inorder model).

- Add branch predictor:
  - Feedback from EXE now indicates whether prediction was right
  - BranchPredictor module now talks to a real predictor using standard
    interface.
  - Configured inorder model to use 2-bit predictor.
  - Still using private BTB.  Changed BTB to drop its entry when it
    causes a taken prediction for a non-branch instruction. (Caused by
    an alias.)

- Increased I and D cache index sizes from 8 to 10 bits.  Reduced miss
  penalty from 20 to 10 cycles.  Trying to get more activity in the
  model and there were a lot of misses given the lack of a 2nd level cache.

Front end next PC logic assumed a full bundle of instructions is fetched
on each cycle and blindly took the next PC from the branch predictor.  When
a full bundle was not fetched instructions were skipped.  All I did was
ignore the branch predictor's idea of the next PC when a full bundle isn't
fetched.  The predictor interface is as broken as ever and IPC of the
modeled machine is still abysmal.  memory_tests_aligned now runs correctly,
though IPC is 0.09.

- Honor the new poison bit in the token that may be set by the functional
  partition.  To do this:

  - Pass updated token all the way through the pipeline.  Many models assumed
    the token would not change after being allocated and kept passing an old
    instance to each functional phase.
  - Superscalar model still caches the decoded token in the ROB, but keeps
    a poison bit on the side.  This is to avoid having to read-modify-write the
    ROB to update the token in ROB BRAM.

- Check the poison bit before commit.  If set send a message back to the front
  end to handle the fault.  Fault is handled by a new functional interface
  that does a rewind, increments the fault epoch (another new token bit)
  and returns the restart PC.

- Rewrote the unpipelined model to initiate the next functional request in
  the same FPGA cycle as the previous functional response is received.  Saves
  about 7 FPGA cycles per simulated instruction.  Also restructured the model
  to use Bluespec rules instead of one bit case statement.  The goal is to
  be a reference implementation of the minimal timing/functional interface.

- Clean up some debugging output.  E.g. simulated cycle now printed for in-order.

- Unpipelined model never called local_ctrl.startModelCC()
- Superscalar model didn't connect to local controllers.  For now just the front
  end is connected and external ports aren't defined, so balancing will not
  work.  The minimal connection added here forces the pipeline to wait for
  permission to run before starting.

Add proper bypassing from EXE and MEM stages.  The control logica already
existed from EXE and MEM back to DEC to support bypassing, but it was used
only to handle dead instructions caused by branch misprediction.  All register
dependence was waiting for earlier instructions to commit!

New code supports full bypassing using 0 latency ports from EXE and MEM back
to DEC.  Dependent instructions can now follow typical ALU instructions
immediately and there is a one cycle bubble for memory loads.  Simulated
performance for Alpha with perfect caches improves by about 80%.

 UnpipelinedCPU.bsv        Locally Modified           89 

Changed token allocation logic in the unpipelined model:
  - New tokens may be allocated for a context whenever processing of the
    previous token for the context is complete.
  - Token allocation remains round-robin among contexts.  Contexts can never
    be more than one cycle apart.
  - Added a skew generator to delay starting contexts at the start of a
    run.  This way multiple hardware contexts all executing the same workload
    will not run in lock step, doing identical operations each cycle.  The
    number of skew cycles is controlled by a dynamic parameter:  SKEW_CONTEXTS.
    Specify 0 to have all contexts start together.

Two-bit branch predictor used no-longer existing hashTo32 function. Changed to
new hashBits

This actually broke the inorder model. It seems our regression didn't run
last night or we would have noticed... :(

* The inorder model is now multi-context. Also it is pipelined within the
  modules across multiple contexts.

* Rewrote all rules to use the new local controller syntax. Most rules have the
  following form:
  
  // Get the current context...
  let ctx_id = stage2Q.first();
  stage2Q.deq();
  
  // Get our local state using the context id.
  let pc = ctx_pc[ctx_id];
  
  // Read and update local state.
  pc <= pc + 4;
  
  // Send a message to another module.
  pcToICache.send(ctx_id, tagged Valid pc);
  
  // Pass the context to the next stage.
  stage2Q.enq(ctx_id);
  
* Thus one stage may be operating in a different context (and thus on a
  different PC register) than other stages.

* The local controller ensures that a context is not in flight multiple times
  simultaneously in a single module. Thus the interface is
  startModelCycle/endModelCycle(ctx);

* The end model cycle call also takes a Path number, which can be useful for
  debugging. This is unused in the hardware and should be optimized away by
  the synthesis tool.

* A special mkPortUncontrolled() A-Port is used by A-Ports which are read later
  in the clock cycle dependent on input - like Cache responses. This could
  perhaps be cleaned up.

* Updated the unpipelined and OOO models to use the new local controller
  interface. The OOO does not actually use the local controller to control its
  ports.

* TODO: Break into multiple AWB modules.

* TODO: Support more multi-context caches.

* Move hasim-models over to the correct file-naming convention. This is a
  precursor to splitting the inorder pipeline model up into many modules.

* Kill the 5stage model.

* Branch predictors are now branch predictor algorithms, which are multiplexed
  by the inorder pipeline's branch predictor.

* Almost all imports are now `include and more type names are in the right
  coding convention.
  
* Still Ongoing: Some directory names need to change. SVN is happier if we do
  that in a separate commit.

* Inorder model is now broken into multiple AWB modules. Submodel APM ensures
  everything still works.
  
* Directory name cleanup continues.

* Store buffer moved from pipeline to caches.

* Inorder non-blocking cache front end pipeline reorganization.
* Inorder now has ITLB (Always hits for now)
* Inorder front end is now: Fetch, IMem, PCCalc, and Instruction Queue
* InstQ ensures instructions block until the ICache response comes back.
* Calls to functional partition are now organized as follows:
** Fetch calls newInFlight
** ITlb calls doITranslate
** L1 ICache calls getInstruction
** PCCalc calls rewind/fault

* Backend re-organization to support non-blocking caches.
* Model IPC with perfect cache now varies from .55 to .85 depending on dependencies and branch predictor accuracy.
* Added DTLB (currently always hits). The backend itself supports resteers.
* Added realistic store-buffer which supports out-of-order machines. Decode stage allocates slots inorder.
* Added write buffer which performs committed stores in order. The DMem stage now checks the DCache/SB/WB in parallel.
* Instructions from the wrong epoch are no longer dropped in EXE, but flow through as nops until they reach commit. 
  This straightens out a lot of interactions with faults and store buffer slots.

* Add pseudo-random DCache model. This uses Dynamic parameters to set cache 
  miss rate/retry rate. Also features many nice statistics.
* doLoads has been moved to DMem stage from DCache. This resolves issues 
  where a WB hit with a D$ retry would result in doLoads not getting called.
* Increase store buffer size to 8 as 4 seemed to be causing strange behavior.
* Fix off-by-one error in store buffer credit.
* Pseudo-random ICache is currently a skeleton (null cache). 
  Next to do is implementing it.

Changed modules to use *MULTIPLEXED with the number of instances NUM_CPUS in
place of *MULTICTX. Multiplexed state is named as fooPool instead of ctx_foo.
CPU_INSTANCE_ID replaces CONTEXT_ID. cpu_iid replaces ctx. Added functions for
the trivial mapping from CONTEXT_ID to CPU_INSTANCE_ID and back. Added new
chip_base_types which defines NUM_CPUS and CPU_INSTANCE_ID.

* Support pseudo-random ICache. This fails to pass the "towers" benchmark for reasons 
  that are well-known and a plan is in place to fix. Null caches are still the default
  for regressions because of this.

* Support moving the epoch from the functional partition to the timing model.

* Altering of models to match the new token allocation scheme.
* The unpipelined model only required minor changes.
* The inorder model front end no longer uses tokens, so it uses InstQ slots
  to distinguish between in-flight fetches.
* The out-of-order model maintains a dummy Decode stage, although 
  getDependencies is now called by the ROB. This stage keeps the ROB's notion
  of credits in sync with the front end.
* The branch predictors no longer use tokens, since they are not available. This
  breaks the globalHistory predictor's notion of updates, but it seems that it
  was already broken and has not been maintained for a while.
